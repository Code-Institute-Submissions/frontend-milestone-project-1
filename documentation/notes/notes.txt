commit 148ae811d63708e2b53871a61ce8a561d4f653e5

12-07-2019
==> lesson learned: concentrate on what I am supposed to do instead of what I can do. A fancy 
carousel with animation was not in the wireframe. Also from SEO perspective not handy, because of 
missing either <h1> or having duplicates which is not a good idea as well.
==> added new functionality; soundcloud player and spotifify follow widget.
