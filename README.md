# Restyle website rapper Lange Frans
---

This is the repository of the frontend only (restyled) website of the Dutch rapper and tv-host Lange Frans. The primary focus of the website is to let fans and potential fans to see and hear video clips and songs and let them know about new music as it becomes available.
The aim of the website is also to link the target group to Spotify to let the fan base grow there. Another aim is to give information about upcoming events where Lange Frans is on stage.
Social media is also integrated to give social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter a presence.

## UX
___

Giving fans and potential fans the ability to see and hear video clips and getting cohesion with Spotify were top of mind while designing. Therefore I created several user stories:

* As an existing fan I want to see video clips 
* As an existing fan I want to hear songs
* As an existing fan I want to follow Lange Frans easily on Spotify
* As an existing fan I want to know when are the upcoming events
* As an existing fan I want to buy tickets for upcoming events
* As a existing fan I want to read something from Lange Frans’ background/bio
* As potential fan I want to see video clips to see if I really like Lange Frans 
* As potential fan I want to hear songs to see if I really like Lange Frans
* As a potential fan I want to read something from Lange Frans’ background/bio
* As an potential fan I might want to follow Lange Frans easily on Spotify
* As an event organization I want to know who I can contact for bookings
* As a journalist I want to know how I can reach the management
